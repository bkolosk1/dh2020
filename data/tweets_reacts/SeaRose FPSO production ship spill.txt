Listen to what Husky has to say about the SeaRose FPSO oil spill. Their first "in person response"
Nalcor's VP of oil and gas, Jim Keating, is back on the stand at the Muskrat Falls inquiry. Andrew Fitzgerald, lawyer for Charles Bown and Julia Mullaley, brings up last week's oil spill at the SeaRose FPSO. He asks about the environmental risks of a subsea pipeline. 
We continue to monitor the spill that was detected at the Husky White Rose field offshore. The @CNLOPB oversees this. The best technology will be deployed to the Searose FPSO to mitigate the size of the spill and clean up all that we can. 
QP: Ches Crosbie begins with last fall's oil spill at the SeaRose FPSO. He asks why the size of the spill wasn't communicated to the public.
UPDATE: The wind was northwest 45 knots. Seas were 8.4 metres when Husky Energy attempted to resume production on the SeaRose FPSO, and oil spill occurred last Friday morning
VOCM - C-NLOPB Investigating 250,000 Litre Oil Spill from SeaRose FPSO 
A Husky exec says it isn't clear exactly why a valve failed, causing a flowline to the SeaRose FPSO to spill an estimated 250,000 litres of oil into the Atlantic Ocean
In QP @GerryRogersMHA says Friday Husky Energy reported spill of 250,000 liters at SeaRose FPSO with possibly more leaking as we speak. Details about the cause & full extent of damage are still not available, & we are forced to rely on info provided by the company itself.
Husky Energy says the spill happened after the production, storage and offloading vessel SeaRose FPSO “experienced a loss of pressure” in an oil flowline to the South White Rose Drill Centre, about 350 kilometres southeast of St. John’s, N.L.
