Total number of jobs created by keystone pipeline is 35… Not worth what The oil spill on November 16, 2017 Did so far 
How r you going to name a pipeline “ KINDER Morgan” like it’s a harmless chocolate egg, and not a hazardous environmental nightmare waiting to happen? Kinder eggs are banned in the US btw, yet despite protest they extended the keystone pipeline which resulted in a 2017 oil spill.
I keep thinking "Keystone Pipeline Spill" is the world's most predictable headline but this is 2017.
It's the second significant spill on the #TCEnergy #Keystone system since 2017, when 4,700 barrels of oil spilled in #SouthDakota. #oilspill Leak in Keystone #pipeline : 9,000 barrels of oil in #NorthDakota
Oil transport: Since 2000, 21 railway spills and 734 pipeline spills of oil over 1,000 gallons have been reported by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). One rail route travels by the Mississippi River through a flood zone for at least 154 miles
The Keystone Pipeline has already suffered multiple spills, including a 210,000-gallon spill in November 2017. We found that the pipeline makes 2,370 waterway crossings, more than 300 crossings in each of the six states it passes through.
The existing Keystone pipeline, however, was responsible for leaking up to 9,700 barrels in South Dakota in 2017. The initial estimate for spill was about 5,000 barrels, or 210,000 gal of oil. Both Keystone and the planned XL line are operated by Ca pipeline giant TransCanada.
Ocasio-Cortez probably confused the Keystone XL pipeline with the Keystone pipeline, which has been operating since 2010. Keystone XL is still under construction, but would also bring oil sands from Canada to Nebraska where it would connect to existing pipeline
"President Trump, just days into his term, opened the door for TC Energy to continue its construction of the pipeline extension after former President Obama denied it a permit in 2015. This is not the first oil spill along the Keystone pipeline...2017."
Keystone pipeline spills over 350,000 gallons of oil in North Dakota 
"This is not the first oil spill along the Keystone pipeline system; an incident in 2017 caused more than 407,000 gallons of crude oil to cover agricultural land in South Dakota in a rural area near the North Dakota border"
Keystone Pipeline Shut Down After Large Oil Spill in South Dakota 
 Recall TransCanada's spill risk assessment estimated that the chance of a leak of more than 50 barrels from Keystone to be “not more than once every seven to 11 years over the entire length of the pipeline in the United States"
