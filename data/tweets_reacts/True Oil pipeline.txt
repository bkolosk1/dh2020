CNBC reporting just now that the #oil #pipeline explosion in Saudi Arabia not true. WTI Oil opens in Asia at $109 in any case.
Oil pipeline vandalism seems to have reduced. Or maybe it's me who is not listening to the news regularly.
Right on and how true.  It's all about an oil pipeline !!  Sad commentary.
True of a domestic oil pipeline, but not a natural gas pipeline.
