""|"A Japanese bulk carrier that has leaked hundreds of tonnes of fuel oil off the Mauritius coast has broken apart, authorities in the island nation say. The MV Wakashio ran aground on a coral reef on 25 July with 4,000 tonnes of the fuel, causing an ecological emergency. Most of the fuel had already been pumped out, officials said, but on Saturday the ship's condition worsened. Mauritius is home to world-renowned coral reefs, and popular with tourists. The MV Wakashio ran aground at Pointe d'Esny, a known sanctuary for rare wildlife. The area also contains wetlands designated as a site of international importance by the Ramsar convention on wetlands. At around 4.30pm [12:30 GMT], a major detachment of the vessel's forward section was observed, the Mauritius National Crisis Committee said in a statement on Saturday. About 90 tonnes of the fuel were believed to be still on board when the vessel split. One of the best assessments of the spill has come via Earth observation assets. The US analytics company Ursa Space Systems looked at the situation using radar data from the Finnish Iceye satellites, which are especially effective at picking out oil on water. It found a 27 sq km spill by 11 August. The committee said booms had been reinforced near the vessel to absorb any more oil that leaked out. Coast guard vessels have been positioned in the area. Mauritius has said it will seek compensation for the leak from the owner and the insurer. Japanese firm Nagashiki Shipping has pledged to respond to requests for compensation. Mauritian Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth said in recent days that more than 3,000 of the 4,000 tonnes of oil from the ship's fuel reservoirs had been pumped out. BBC World Service environment correspondent Navid Singh Khadka says a spill three times the size of this was averted. Nevertheless a uniquely biodiversity-rich marine ecosystem has been polluted with nearly 1,000 tonnes of fuel oil. Last week, Mr Jugnauth declared a state of emergency and appealed for international help. Since then, volunteers have also been collecting straw from fields and filling sacks to make barriers against the oil. Others have made their own tubes with tights and hair to add to the effort, and some have been cleaning up the island's beaches. Their actions went against an order from the government asking people to leave the clean-up to local authorities. Greenpeace Africa has warned that thousands of animal species were at risk of drowning in a sea of pollution, with dire consequences for Mauritius's economy, food security and health. An oceanographer and environmental engineer in Mauritius, Vassen Kauppaymuthoo, told the BBC that local residents were now breathing heavy vapours of oil, and there was a mixture of sadness and anger over the spill. Police in Mauritius say they have been granted a search warrant, allowing them to board the vessel to take away items of interest such as the ship's log book in order to help with an investigation. The ship's captain will assist officers with their search."
"Responding to MV Wakashio oil spill"|"MO has joined international efforts to respond to the oil spill involving the bulk carrier MV Wakashio, off the coast of Mauritius. IMO and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA) jointly deployed an expert, who advised the Government of Mauritius on the mitigation of the impacts on the environment and coastal communities. Click for statement on IMO's role in the response to the oil spill caused by the grounding of the MV Wakashio 1. What is IMO doing in response to the oil spill in Mauritius? An expert in oil spill response was deployed to Mauritius by IMO and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA), following a request for assistance from the Government of Mauritius. He was on scene between 12 August and 4 September. The expert's role was to support the Government of Mauritius by providing technical advice on issues related to oil spill response. He took part in a number of field visits and operational meetings and liaised with the various stakeholders involved in the response efforts.The IMO Secretariat is also supporting the response, by providing backstopping to the IMO expert in the field at the time of his deployment, and has been maintaining close liaison with the affected country, the flag State and technical partners throughout in order to provide support and assistance, as required.    2. What exactly was the expert's mandate in Mauritius? The expert deployed by IMO advised on oil spill response and related matters – such as clean-up strategies, communication, guidance for volunteers, incident management, etc. His mandate also included assisting with possible follow-up actions, such as the review of the national oil spill contingency plan.The expert did not advise directly on matters related to the salvage and disposal of the MV Wakashio, which are managed by the company SMIT Salvage, in consultation with the ship owner and the Government of Mauritius. The expert provided advice only insofar as it was related to oil spill response matters.3. What do we know about the incident involving the MV Wakashio? The bulk carrier MV Wakashio grounded on a reef at Pointe d'Ensy, on the south-eastern coast of Mauritius, on 25 July 2020. It was not carrying any cargo, but an estimated 3,894 tonnes of low-sulphur fuel oil, 207 tonnes of diesel and 90 tonnes of lubricant oil were on board. As of 11 August, reports indicated that approximately 1000 tonnes of oil had leaked into the ocean. This figure will be refined as the oil spill response operation progresses. An estimated 3,000 tonnes of fuel have been successfully removed from the MV Wakashio before it broke in two parts, on 15 August 2020 – hence preventing further damage to the ecosystem. The affected area is located in an ecologically sensitive area that includes the Blue Bay Marine Park, Ile aux Aigrettes, and the Ramsar sites. 4. Will there be an independent investigation? A casualty investigation is mandatory (under the SOLAS, MARPOL and Load Lines treaties) and this should be initiated as soon as possible, in order to understand why the incident occurred and so that IMO can follow up on any recommendations. Casualty investigations fall under the realm of the flag State – in this case, Panama, which has indicated its intention to proceed with an investigation. The flag State is required to liaise with other interested States and parties, including the coastal State which has been impacted by an environmental damage.5. How does the liability and compensation regime work? Mauritius is party to the 2001 Bunkers Convention, which establishes strict liability for the shipowner  for oil pollution damage from bunkers (fuel oil carried by a ship for its own propulsion or operations). However, this liability could be limited by another regime such as the 1976 Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims (LLMC 76) or its 1996 Protocol. The 2001 Bunkers Convention also requires ships to be insured for all related damage and pollution claims up to the limits of liability. The MV Wakashio has a compulsory insurance for material damage and pollution claims of up to 46.5 million SDR (equal to the 1996 LLMC Protocol limits, as amended). Panama, the flag State of the MV Wakashio, is also a State Party to the Bunkers Convention. Mauritius is party to LLMC 76, which would set the limit of liability for material damage and pollution claims covered in the MV Wakashio case at 13 million SDR. Japan (where the shipowner is established) is party to LLMC Protocol 96, which sets the limit at 46.5 million SDR (equal to the related Bunkers Convention compulsory insurance requirement). The Government of Mauritius, businesses and individuals will be able to claim compensation following the MV Wakashio oil spill on the basis of the 2001 Bunkers Convention. In case limitation would be invoked by the shipowner in the courts of Mauritius, which is party to LLMC 76 only, a limit of almost 13 million SDR would apply. However, the shipowner may have to establish a higher limitation fund of up to 46.5 million SDR if claims (other than under the Bunkers Convention) are already brought in a state that is Party to LLMC 96, like Japan. Given that the ship involved is a bulk carrier, international conventions specific to pollution damage caused by oil tankers (such as the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund regime) do not apply in this case. 6. What do we know about the long-term effects of VLSFO on the environment? The spill involved a type of fuel known as Very Low Sulphur Fuel Oil (VLSFO) – a blend developed to reduce sulphur oxides emissions in line with a new limit that came into force on 1 January 2020. This new limit, known as IMO 2020, brings significant benefits for human health and the environment. While new low sulphur oils may have different chemical compositions than their traditional bunker counterparts, they are nevertheless petroleum products that behave in a predictably similar way to traditional bunker fuels. The response to the spill from MV Wakashio has included the use of existing well-established oil spill response strategies and techniques. Their efficiencies was regularly assessed, as would be the case in any spill response, and they have proven effective in responding to this new generation of fuels. The long-term impacts of these new fuels are being further examined by research institutions.  7. Why was the area not recognised as a PSSA? Mauritius has not so far applied to designate any area as a Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA). The decision to initiate such a process is entirely up to the IMO Member State. The PSSA designation is a tool available to any IMO Member State to enhance the protection of a specific area. The designation has to be connected to specific associated protective measures, which are applied through the IMO regulatory framework, to limit the impact of international shipping on sensitive areas, such as fragile ecosystems. Associated protective measures can vary from one PSSA to another, as they are chosen carefully depending on each specific situation to provide the best possible balance between protection and shipping needs. They can be any measure available under an IMO treaty, such as ship routeing measures, areas to be avoided and installation of Vessel Traffic Services (VTS). States can also apply for ship routeing systems to be adopted, without having a PSSA designation. 8. Was IMO involved in the planned sinking of the front part of MW Wakashio? Decisions regarding salvage operations, including the towing and planned sinking of the bow section of MV Wakashio, are entirely made by the Government of Mauritius, in dialogue with the salvage company and representatives of the ship owner. Advice from the IMO expert was strictly limited to oil spill response and mitigation measures, whether from the bunker fuel, any other type of oil remaining on board, and any other potential risks of pollution from the response operations.  After a number of options were considered, the planned sinking of the forward section of the ship at 13 nautical miles in 2000m depth was completed on Monday 24 August at around 3.30PM (local time). The decision was made by the Government of Mauritius in consultation with the salvage company and the authorities of La Reunion, as well as local environmental NGOs, to ensure both practical and environmental concerns were fully taken into account. 9. Under international law, what falls under the responsibility of IMO in terms of oil spill response? Can IMO intervene on its own initiative or force governments to take certain measures? IMO can only provide support on oil spill response at the invitation of a Member State. The International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co-operation 1990 (OPRC 90) includes provisions for requesting the Organization's assistance in the event of a spill, as well as other types of resources, expertise and assistance as may be required. It also provides a framework for facilitating international co-operation and mutual assistance in preparing for and responding to major oil pollution incidents.The Government of Mauritius is responsible for the decisions relating to oil spill response and salvage of the MV Wakashio, with IMO playing an advisory role.  10. What is IMO doing to prevent oil spills from happening in the first place, and to assist in contingency planning? In the case of oil spills, prevention is always better than cure. IMO has adopted a comprehensive set of regulations designed to enhance safety of shipping, to prevent accidents occurring in the first place, and to mitigate the impacts of an accident should one occur. These regulations address everything from construction of ships to safety management to training of seafarers. The system of mandatory casualty investigation and feedback into the regulatory system is intended to ensure any lessons are learned from a casualty, so action can be taken to better enforce existing regulation, or, if deemed necessary, to update or amend the regulatory framework. When it comes to pollution preparedness, each year, IMO through its Technical Cooperation Programme, organises a number of workshops around the world to strengthen national capacities and enhance regional preparedness in case of oil spills on topics such as incident management, shoreline response, contingency planning, liability and compensation, transboundary cooperation and waste management. Additionally, IMO has an established network of experts that can be called upon and deployed – based on a request for assistance by a Member State – to provide advice and technical assistance in the event of an oil spill.  IMO has also developed and published numerous guides on topics related to oil pollution preparedness to support Member States in preparing for and responding to such incidents. IMO co-sponsors the triennial conference series encompassing the International Oil Spill Conference (Americas)  Interspill (Europe), Spillcon (Asia Pacific), alternating on a three-year cycle, where experts and Government officials come together to share the latest technical information and research relating to oil pollution preparedness and response.

"Birthday party on ship may have led to oil spill in Mauritius"|"Panama regulator says, A Japanese ship that ran aground on a coral reef off Mauritius may have changed course to get a mobile data signal for a birthday celebration on board, according to investigators from Panama, the country under whose flag the vessel was sailing. The M.V. Wakashio crashed into the coral reef barrier on July 25 and leaked almost 1,000 tonnes of fuel oil into Mauritian waters. The vessel’s captain was taken into custody on Aug. 18 for endangering safe navigation as Mauritian authorities said the ship failed to respond to several calls from the Mauritian Coast Guard. Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL), the Japanese company operating the ship, has pledged 1 billion yen ($9.5 million) for environmental preservation efforts and to shore up local fisheries. A Japanese ship that wrecked off the coast of Mauritius in July and sparked one of the worst environmental disasters in the country’s history may have run aground because of birthday celebrations on board at the time. That’s according to a statement from the Panama Maritime Authority (AMP), in the latest development from the July 25 wrecking of the Panama-flagged and Japanese-owned M.V. Wakashio, a bulk carrier. The ship, bound for Brazil from Singapore, was sailing through Mauritian waters when it ran aground on a coral reef and leaked almost 1,000 tonnes of fuel oil. In its statement published in Spanish on Sept. 7, the AMP, which is collaborating in the investigation into the accident, said the ship diverted its navigation plan, possibly in relation to “the celebration of the birthday of one of the crew members.”"
"IMO helping to mitigate the impacts of MV Wakashio oil spill in Mauritius"|"IMO continues to support international efforts to respond to the oil spill in Mauritius, following the break up of the MV Wakashio. IMO continues to support international efforts to respond to the oil spill in Mauritius, following the break up of the MV Wakashio. IMO and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA) have jointly deployed an expert, who is advising the Government of Mauritius on the mitigation of the impacts on the environment and coastal communities. The oil spill response expert has been on the scene since 12 August, providing technical advice, taking part in a number of field visits and operational meetings, and liaising with the various stakeholders involved in the response efforts.  Reports indicate that most of the oil on board the MV Wakashio had been removed before the vessel broke in two sections on Saturday 15 August. It is estimated that more than 3,000 tonnes of fuel have been extracted, but some residue and other oil remain in the stern section. The focus of operations on scene is now moving towards salvage and removal of the ship, as well as continued recovery of floating oil and beach clean-up. The affected area is located in a very sensitive zone that includes the Blue Bay Marine Park, Ile aux Aigrettes, and the Ramsar sites.  IMO Secretary-General Kitack Lim said: I would like to commend all those involved in the international efforts to support the Government of Mauritius and to mitigate the impact of the oil spill from the MV Wakashio.   I look forward to a full investigation into the incident so that the results and findings can be brought to IMO and we can act on any recommendations, Mr Lim added.  IMO continues to collaborate with other UN entities, including OCHA, UNDP and UNOSAT, as well as other stakeholders involved in the response effort. A number of countries, including France and Japan, are also assisting Mauritius, which has activated its national oil spill contingency plan. Alongside IMO and OCHA, the ship owner and ITOPF are also mobilising environmental and oil spill experts. The company SMIT Salvage has been appointed by the vessel owner to oversee the salvage operations. The IMO's liability and compensation regime is partly in play for this incident. The Wakashio has compulsory insurance under the 2001 Bunkers Convention concerning all material damage and pollution claims up to the applicable limits in accordance with relevant instruments (including LLMC) and national legislation in force. Given that the ship involved is a bulk carrier, other international conventions specific to pollution damage caused by oil tankers (such as the IOPC Fund regime) do not apply in this case.  MV Wakashio ran aground on 25 July off Pointe d’Esny natural area, on the south-eastern coast of Mauritius and started leaking oil following severe weather conditions. An estimated 3,894 tonnes of low-sulphur fuel oil, 207 tonnes of diesel and 90 tonnes of lubricant oil were on board."
"The Wakashio oil spill in Mauritius – what happened and lessons learnt"|"The MV Wakashio left China on 14 July, heading for Brazil. The vessel, owned by Nagashiki Shipping and operated by Mitsui OSK Lines Ltd, hit a coral reef, Pointe d’Esny,  Mauritius on 25 July, 2020. What is significant about this incident is that the vessel was carrying 4,000 tonnes of heavy oil, lubricants and diesel, a large amount of which was pumped out but a significant amount still entered into the Indian Ocean. No oil leakage was reported at the time, and the Mauritius coast guard swiftly deployed booms and took other preventive actions. The government activated its National Oil Spill Contingency Plan the following day. By 5th August, a minor oil slick was observed surrounding the vessel. It was still assumed that the country’s contingency plan was sufficient and that ‘the risk of oil spill was still low‘. Only after this did things get out of hand – the vessel began flooding and sinking. It then split into two and spilled at least 1,000 tons of oil into the Indian Ocean. On 7 August Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth declared a national environment emergency. Fisheries Minister Sudheer Maudhoo stated that “this is the first time that we are faced with a catastrophe of this kind and we are insufficiently equipped to handle this problem.” Mauritius called for international help once the scale of the emergency became apparent and quickly overwhelmed the resources and capacity of the country’s national contingency plan. Environmental Impact The Mauritius oil spill has been in the news repeatedly and rightly so, for various reasons – the biggest being that it has endangered world-renowned coral reefs and lagoons. The island nation of about 1.3 million people is still grappling with how to protect its world-renowned coral reefs and crystal-clear lagoons after the spill. The BBC reported that rather than the size of the oil spill, it was the area where it happened, which was a cause for concern. The accident took place near two environmentally protected marine ecosystems and the Blue Bay Marine Park Reserve, which is a wetland of international importance. Oil spills affect marine life by exposing them to harsh elements and destroying their sources of food and habitat. Further, both birds and mammals can die from hypothermia as a result of oil spills, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). For instance, oil destroys the insulating ability of fur-bearing mammals, such as sea otters. It also decreases the water repellency of birds’ feathers, without which they lose their ability to repel cold water. MV Wakashio mauritius oil spill - shipping and freight resource The Backstory Since the 1990s, Mauritius has received substantial capacity-building assistance to prevent an oil spill. The country was a core beneficiary in two multi-million-dollar World Bank projects – the $4-million Western Indian Ocean Island Oil Spill Contingency Plan from 1998 and 2003 and the $24-million Western Indian Ocean Marine Highway Development and Coastal and Marine Contamination Prevention Project from 2007-2012. In June 2016 on the back of a bulk carrier running aground in Mauritius, oceanographer and environmental engineer Vassen Kauppaymuthoo warned authorities to be better prepared for bigger maritime disasters. No one listened, he says. “The sad thing is that we had a sign four years ago with MV Benita, the ship first grounded at Le Bouchon. At that time, I raised my voice and said we should prepare for a larger disaster, we should see how the surveillance of our maritime zone has changed in 2016, that it shouldn’t happen again. We should buy oil booms to be prepared, and buy more equipment to be prepared for a larger disaster.” Officials have yet to reveal why the ship, which was making its way from Singapore to Brazil, had come so close to the island, which is now reeling from ecological disaster. “We arrested the captain and his second-in-command today. They were taken to court on a pro-visionary charge. The investigation continues from tomorrow with the interrogation of other crew members,” said spokesman Inspector Shiva Coothen. The ship’s captain, Sunil Kumar Nandeshwar, an Indian national, was arrested alongside the chief officer of the ship, Tilak Ratna Suboda, a Sri Lankan. The two were charged under the piracy and maritime violence act and will reappear in court on August 25. Clean-up measures There are a few ways to clean up oil spills. including skimming, in situ burning and by releasing chemical dispersants. Skimming involves removing oil from the sea surface before it is able to reach the sensitive areas along the coastline. In situ burning means burning a particular patch of oil after it has concentrated in one area. Oil booms are floating barriers, placed around the oil or whatever is leaking the oil. Equipment called containment booms acts like fences to prevent the oil from further spreading or floating away. Once the oil booms confine the oil, skimmers or oil scoops can be deployed on to boats to remove the contaminants from the surface of water. As the name suggests, for burning in-situ, the oil floating on the surface is ignited to burn it off. This in-situ burning of oil can effectively remove up to 98% of an oil spill, which is more than most of the other methods. However, the toxic fumes released from the burning can cause significant damage to the environment as well as marine life. Releasing chemical dispersants helps break down oil into smaller droplets, making it easier for microbes to consume, and further break it down into less harmful compounds. Lessons learnt Governments require up-to-date assessments to plan future responses. Better and more collective resources and skills at a regional or continental level are required. Improved accountability mechanisms are also important. The Japanese owners of the MV Wakashio have offered, under international obligations, to pay compensation for applicable damages caused by the oil spill. Yet in other cases, it might not be as easy to track the owners and determine liability. The Institute for Security Studies, states, “It is time for African maritime institutions to review their approaches and develop appropriate expertise and response mechanisms. This should ensure fast and effective regional or continental action when the inevitable oil leaks arise. The results should be reported to key multilateral organisations – ideally to the African Union (AU) – as part of the implementation of 2050 Africa’s Integrated Maritime Strategy. The AU could, for instance, convene a consultative forum for experience and skills sharing with inputs from all the regional economic communities such as that hosted by the Southern African Development Community in 2018. Disaster relief is expensive but is nowhere near as controversial as other maritime issues such as creating security frameworks and determining boundaries. It can also foster collaboration anchored in regional AU institutions that draw on indigenous expertise and capacities."
